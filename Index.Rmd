Hi, I'm **Wanting Dong** ðŸ‘‹  
I'm a MPH candidate in Epidemiology at **Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health**.  

My research interests focus on **Neurodenegerative Diseases**, **Real-World Evidence Analysis**, and **Phamarcoepidmeiology**.  
Currently, my thesis focuses on Regression discontinuity design to evaluate the effect of statins on myocardial infarction in electronic health records.
